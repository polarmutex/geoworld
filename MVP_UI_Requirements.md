# GeoWorld MVP UI Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the minimum viable product (MVP) requirements for the GeoWorld geospatial data visualization platform's user interface. The MVP focuses on core functionality needed to demonstrate the platform's value proposition.

## Target Users
- **Primary**: GIS analysts and data scientists
- **Secondary**: Emergency responders and field operators
- **Tertiary**: Urban planners and researchers

## MVP User Stories

### Core Map Interface
- **As a user**, I want to see an interactive map as the central interface so I can visualize geospatial data
- **As a user**, I want to pan, zoom, and navigate the map so I can explore different geographic areas
- **As a user**, I want to switch between different map layers (satellite, street, terrain) so I can choose the most appropriate background

### Data Source Management
- **As a user**, I want to connect to a streaming data source so I can view real-time geospatial data
- **As a user**, I want to see a list of available data sources so I can manage my connections
- **As a user**, I want to toggle data sources on/off so I can control what information is displayed

### Basic Tools
- **As a user**, I want to measure distances between points so I can perform basic spatial analysis
- **As a user**, I want to place markers on the map so I can mark points of interest
- **As a user**, I want to see coordinates when I click on the map so I can identify specific locations

### Workspace Management
- **As a user**, I want dockable panels so I can customize my workspace layout
- **As a user**, I want to save my workspace configuration so I can restore it between sessions

## MVP UI Components

### 1. Main Map View
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
- Full-screen interactive map widget
- Standard map controls (zoom, pan, rotate)
- Map layer selector (dropdown or buttons)
- Coordinate display in status bar
- Scale indicator

### 2. Data Sources Panel
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
- Dockable panel (default: left side)
- List of available data sources
- Connection status indicators
- Enable/disable toggles per source
- Basic connection settings

### 3. Tools Panel
**Priority**: P1 (High)
- Dockable panel (default: right side)
- Distance measurement tool
- Point marker tool
- Basic drawing tools (lines, polygons)
- Tool settings and options

### 4. Status Bar
**Priority**: P1 (High)
- Current mouse coordinates
- Map scale and zoom level
- Connection status summary
- Active tool indicator

### 5. Menu Bar
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
- File menu (open/save workspace)
- View menu (panel visibility, map layers)
- Tools menu (activate measurement tools)
- Help menu (about, documentation)

### 6. Toolbar
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
- Quick access to common tools
- Map navigation controls
- Data source connection buttons
- Workspace save/load

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Map rendering at 60 FPS during navigation
- < 100ms response time for tool interactions
- Support for 10,000+ simultaneous data points
- Smooth streaming data updates (30 FPS)

### Usability
- Intuitive drag-and-drop panel arrangement
- Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
- Context menus for map interactions
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### Data Handling
- Real-time data streaming without blocking UI
- Efficient memory management for large datasets
- Data point clustering for performance
- Configurable data update intervals

## MVP Limitations (Out of Scope)

### Deferred Features
- Advanced geospatial analysis tools
- Multi-user collaboration
- Data export functionality
- Custom plugin development UI
- 3D visualization
- Mobile web interface optimization
- Advanced styling/theming options

### Technical Constraints
- Desktop application only (web interface in future releases)
- Limited to 5 simultaneous data sources
- Basic authentication only
- No offline map caching
- Limited to standard map projections

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] User can load and navigate an interactive map
- [ ] User can connect to at least one streaming data source
- [ ] User can measure distances between points
- [ ] User can place and remove markers
- [ ] User can rearrange docking panels
- [ ] User can save and restore workspace layouts

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Map loads within 3 seconds
- [ ] Streaming data updates without noticeable lag
- [ ] Panel docking operations feel responsive
- [ ] No memory leaks during 1-hour usage sessions

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] New users can complete basic tasks within 5 minutes
- [ ] Interface feels familiar to GIS software users
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Help documentation covers all MVP features

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Map (Week 1-2)
- Basic map widget with navigation
- Map layer switching
- Coordinate display

### Phase 2: Data Integration (Week 3-4)
- Data source connection framework
- Real-time data streaming
- Data point visualization

### Phase 3: Tools (Week 5-6)
- Distance measurement tool
- Point marker functionality
- Basic drawing tools

### Phase 4: Workspace (Week 7-8)
- Docking system integration
- Panel management
- Configuration persistence

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Risk**: Qt Advanced Docking System integration complexity
- **Mitigation**: Start with basic docking, iterate on advanced features

### UX Risks
- **Risk**: Overwhelming interface for new users
- **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure, hide advanced features initially

### Performance Risks
- **Risk**: Streaming data causing UI freezing
- **Mitigation**: Implement proper threading, data throttling
